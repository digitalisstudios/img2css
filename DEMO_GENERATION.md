# Demo Image Generation

To generate the visual demo image for the README:

1. Open `create-demo-image.html` in a browser
2. Click "Generate Demo Image" 
3. Click "Download Demo Image"
4. Save as `demo-visual.png` in the root directory

The demo shows:
- Original image with sampling indicators (red lines)
- Generated CSS gradient result
- Technical details and process explanation
- Benefits and features

## Demo Files

- `create-demo-image.html` - Main demo image generator (keep)
- `auto-demo.html` - Interactive demonstration (can remove)
- `generate-demo.html` - Advanced demo with controls (can remove)

Only `create-demo-image.html` is needed for generating the README demo image.
